                                I use a variety of technologies depending on the requirements of each project.
                                Some of the commonly used technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS,
                                Express JS, Python (with Django or Flask), SQL databases (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL,

                                and Git for version control.

                                ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a programming technique used to convert
                                data between incompatible type systems, i.e., between object-oriented programming
                                languages and relational databases.

                                In an ORM system, each table in a relational database is mapped to a class in the
                                programming language, and each row in the table is represented as an object of that
                                class. This allows developers to interact with the database using objects and methods,
                                rather than writing SQL queries directly.

                                ORMs provide a level of abstraction that simplifies database interactions and makes code
                                more maintainable and readable.

                                authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA)
                                and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized personnel can access
                                and modify critical information.
                                For instance, in a Django application where users can log in, it's crucial to prevent
                                unintended access to administrative sections. By default, Django allows registered users
                                to access the admin section with the same password they used to log into your account,
                                potentially granting them administrative privileges across the entire site.
                                To address this, customization of the Django user class backend is necessary to limit
                                user access appropriately.

                                and Node.js, to help enforce coding standards, detect syntax errors, and promote

                                Within my portfolio, I have been exposed to many technologies and frameworks, ranging
                                from technologies like Python, HTML, JS, Fetch-APIs, etc to frameworks like Django,
                                Flask, Express JS, to name but a few. However, there are tools and technologies that I
                                haven't been exposed to yet, and I would love to explore them to enhance my software's
                                capabilities. Some of the frameworks and technologies that I am eager to incorporate
                                include React, Vue, C#, .NET, and TypeScript. These frameworks offer robust solutions
                                for various aspects of software development, such as user interface design, backend
                                functionality, and language enhancements.

                                React, for instance, is renowned for its component-based approach to building user
                                interfaces, which can result in more efficient and maintainable code. C# and .NET, on
                                the other hand, provide powerful tools for backend development, offering scalability,
                                security, and performance. TypeScript, as a superset of JavaScript, brings static typing
                                and other advanced features to the table, enabling developers to catch errors early and
                                write more predictable code.

                                libraries, etc or emerging protocols and standards that could further enhance Porfilo's
